Learn Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

Introduction:

    This repository is intended for understanding different data structures and implementing them in python.
    Over the course of learning, different programming exercises are going to be solved with different algorithms.

Learning Structure:

    Each week,
  
    1. Choose a theoretical concept, read and learn about it.
    2. Choose programming question(s), write algorithm(s) and implement. Each programming question should have respective algorithm(s) and implementation(s).

   For each week you will find

    1. Code Snippets in week(n) code folder
    2. Wiki document(s) in week(n) Wiki folder
